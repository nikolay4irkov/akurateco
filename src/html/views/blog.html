                  With the growing popularity of online shopping and
                  cross-border e-commerce,<strong>
                    the demand for payment processing</strong
                  >
                  is ever so high. Online merchants faced with the necessity to
                  process all of their payments online are in a never-ending
                  search for better solutions. Quite recently the landscape of
                  the market was drastically changed with the emergence of
                  <strong>white-label payment processing</strong>, an
                  alternative to the traditional payment flow. And in this
                  article, we’ll explore both of these processing models, look
                  into their pros and cons, and help you better understand which
                  one will work best for your business.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But first, let’s discuss the notion of “payment processing”.
                </p>
                <h2>What is payment processing?</h2>
                <p>
                  <strong>Payment processing</strong>, in its essence, is a
                  process or a payment flow that occurs right after the customer
                  clicks “Pay Now”. Thus, the main payment processing goal is to
                  facilitate all the necessary steps to authenticate and verify
                  a transaction and then transfer the funds from the customer’s
                  to the merchant’s account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among parties involved in online payment processing are a
                  customer, a payment processor, a merchant (or a business
                  owner), a payment system like Akurateco, an issuing and an
                  acquiring bank, and a credit card company.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are
                  <strong
                    >three ways how a merchant can receive transactions</strong

                  <li aria-level="1">A white-label payment gateway.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Let’s look at each of these options in greater detail.</p>
                <h2>How to create your own payment gateway</h2>
                <p>
                  <strong>Creating your own payment gateway</strong> is by far
                  the most resources and time-consuming of all these ways. It
                  starts with hiring a team of payment technology experts to
                  develop and, consequently, maintain your payment gateway. Then
                  it requires obtaining a license, establishing business
                  relationships with banks, and integrating a number of payment
                  methods to meet the needs of your existing and potential
                  clients in case you decide to expand your business.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All in all, the process of developing your own payment gateway
                  will take months of active development and later will eat up a
                  great deal of your budget in continuous upgrades, technical
                  support, bug fixing, and general maintenance of the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is a way to go for large corporations that can afford an
                  in-house expert team to do the hard work behind the payment
                  gateway. However, if you’re a smaller company or just don’t
                  want to take the risk, you might want to consider one of the
                  next options.

                <h2>What is traditional payment processing?</h2>
                <p>
                  <strong>Traditional payment processing</strong> occurs when a
                  merchant integrates a third-party payment gateway into his
                  system. This way the system redirects the customer to a
                  payment page on the processor’s side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Studies show that redirections often confuse users causing a
                  lot of them to <strong>abandon the cart</strong>. The reason
                  lies in the lack of trust. The customer might trust you as a
                  merchant if he did his research and read the reviews. However,
                  when the payment page he’s redirected to is owned and run by a
                  third party he’s not familiar with, the user might feel
                  frustrated and discouraged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That is why going for a payment gateway you can embed into
                  your website or fully brand following your company’s style
                  guidelines can help you
                  <strong>capture more revenue</strong> by keeping a bigger
                  share of the clients on your site. This method of payment
                  processing is known as “white-label payment processing,” and
                  we’ll talk about it next using

                <h2>What’s white-label payment processing?</h2>
                <p>
                  <strong>White-label payment processing</strong> is a way to
                  process transactions using third-party payment technology
                  fully-branded after your company’s brand identity guidelines.
                  As a merchant, you get to

                    team</strong
                  >
                  of payment experts. In the meantime, your customers will
                  perceive the system as your own. It will have your company
                  logo, colors, and other corporate-style indicators.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s right there in the name. Imagine buying a product but
                  instead of the logo of the producer, there’s a blank white
                  space. You get to snap your logo on it and sell it as your
                  own. You <strong>get the credit for a job well done</strong>,
                  and you don’t have to carry the burden of maintaining the
                  software, expanding the feature base, and implementing new
                  industry-specific changes and upgrades. All of these are on

                  White-label payment processing best fits the need of small and
                  medium-sized businesses with multiple payment channels as well
                  as payment processors aiming to consolidate their payment data
                  in a single platform.

                <p>
                  Payment processing can eat up a great chunk of your budget
                  unless chosen wisely. Therefore, we recommend doing your
                  research before committing.

                      Analyze the size of your client base, average sales volume
                      you need processed every month, and the speed of market
                      growth. Thus, if you’re running a seven-figure business,
                      then developing your own payment gateway can be an option.
                      You’ll save on commissions and will be able to manage all
                      of the transaction flow from within the company. It’ll be
                      faster and more efficient.<br />
                      However, if you’re just starting, look into outsourcing
                      your payment processing to a third party or even going
                      white-label all the way. The latter option helps you
                      convert more customers. And if you’re looking for a

                      Don’t be rushed into making a decision. With the growing

                      market is growing and expanding in leaps and bounds.
                      Therefore, your options are many. And it’s easy to fall
                      victim to good marketing for a poorly delivered product.
                      So, to avoid this, look into:

                    <strong>Reviews.</strong><br />
                    Look for case studies and real reviews on trustworthy
                    platforms. Keep your eyes open. Alternatively, ask around
                    about a provider of your interest.

                  <li aria-level="1">
                    <strong>Rates</strong>.<br />
                    This is a no-brainer. Rates will vary depending on your
                    industry, product, and sales volume. But no matter what your
                    business is, there’s always wiggle room in pricing. So, shop
                    around before sealing the deal.

                  <li aria-level="1">
                    <strong>Flexibility.</strong><br />
                    Can the provider customize the platform to the specific
                    needs of your business? Are they ready to integrate new
                    payment methods your target audience is most comfortable
                    with? Does the technical support react fast and solve the
                    issues right away? These are all very important issues. Time
                    is money. In your case, it literally is. So, the system must
                    be nothing short of perfect.

                    <strong>Payment methods.</strong><br />
                    Does the software have all the payment methods you need
                    integrated? If not, how long will it take to set them up?
                    For instance, at Akurateco, a new payment method can be up
                    and running in under a week.

                    looking for smart routing, cascading, and cutting-edge fraud
                    and chargeback prevention systems. On the other hand,
                    low-risk businesses should consider outsourcing their

                    flexible fee structure, and a fee calendar.
